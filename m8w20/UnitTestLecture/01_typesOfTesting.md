# What are some types of testing that we have covered?

Sushi -> Sushi AI Chef

- Unit Tests (TDD) -> One part/function -> Can this AI sushi chef create a california roll
    - Happy Path
    - Sad Path
- Integration Testing -> How one part fits with the rest of the code. 
    -> Can the AI sushi chef work with other AI/regular chefs?
    -> Can it create a california roll and serve it?


- Regression Testing -> Version changes
- end-to-end - testing the app like a user(we will learn this in the next lecture)
- manual -  the dev is running the code
