# Custom Hooks

## React Hooks

* `useEffect(callback, [])`: Side effect that occurs on data change *or* initial load of a component.
* `useState()`: Helps us manage data that may change; lets React know to re-render if a change occurs.

## Custom Hooks

We can break out our business logic from our component, reducing bloat in component and giving us a way to re-use functionality from component to component.

Note how much smaller are components become as we break out complex pieces into separate hooks. They get to be separate, specialized, and it gives us the opportunity to make much of our code more re-usable!
